# crud_project

<p>This is a CRUD project without a database connection. </p>

Where I created a class called 'VirtualDB' to save the register on memory.
I have implemented a repository pattern too. 
Currently, the project has one CRUD client as an example. 
In this project, I use the package called 'brasil_fields', that helps me with some masks input, validation with CPF/CNPJ(document id for brazilians).  
However, in the future, I may create more examples, such as; products, photos, and others
